What is SQL?
    o SQL, Structured Query Language
        - pronounced SQL
        - DDL, Data Definition Language
        - DML, Data Manipulation Language
    o Relational Database
        - data in rows and columns
    o Standard SQL
        - single quotes
        - "LIMIT n" clause limits number of selected rows
        - DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] table
        - empty string is not null
        - default column definition allows NULL, use NOT NULL to require values

Fundamentals
    o database is a collection of tables
    o Standard SQL
        - SQL 86
        - SQL 2011 (current)
    o SQL syntax
        - use ; for statement terminators
        - case insensitive
        - comments '--' for single-line, and java style multi-line

Standard SQL
    o LIMIT <n>
        - clause to limit number of returned rows
    o column nullability
        - default is to allow NULL values
        - use NOT NULL to require values
        - an empty string is considered distinct from NULL
        - NULL columns are immune from the UNIQUE constraint
        - NULL values sort as minimum values
    o no standard syntax for creating auto-populated ID columns

        - SQLite, syntax is PRIMARY KEY constraint on an INTEGER column
    o LIKE clause
        - '_' is a wildcard that matches one character
        - '%' is a wildcard that matches zero or more characters
        - match is case-insensitive
    o CASE WHEN a
        - does a boolean test, and only zero if false
    o SELECT'ing a boolean expression returns 0 or 1

Relationships
    o joining A (left) to B (right)
    o INNER JOIN, rows where B.key matches A.key
        - syntax: JOIN ... ON
    o LEFT OUTER JOIN, INNER JOIN plus rows A.key not matched to a row in B
        - syntax: LEFT JOIN ... ON
        - all B columns in select list are NULL
    o RIGHT OUTER JOIN, INNER JOIN plus rows B.key not matched to a row in A
        - all A columns in select list are NULL
        - not supported on many databases (so not standard?)
        - can be achieved by reversing A and B
    o FULL OUTER JOIN, combination of all three joins
        - not supported on many databases

Strings
    o use single quotes
    o concatenation is not standardized
    o LENGTH(s), not a standard function, but common
    o SUBSTR(start [, end]), not standard, and one-based
    o TRIM, because leading and trailing spaces are not trimmed by default
    o equality testing is case sensitive (unlike LIKE)

Numeric
    o no standard types or functions

Aggregates
    o when aggregating on a column, NULL values are ignored

Sub-selects
    o a SELECT essentially creates a table, so ...
    o a sub-SELECT can be used wherever a table is expected
    o no different that defining a view using the SELECT
