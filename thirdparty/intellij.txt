Comparison to eclipse
    o no workspace
        + one project at a time
        + project may be comprised of multiple modules
        + can simulate multi-project eclipse workspace with a multi-module project
    o no perspectives
        + intellij is context sensitive, brings up "right" views
        + can this be configured?
