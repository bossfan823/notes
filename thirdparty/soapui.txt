First SoapUI session


Ten tips for beginners
    1. right click your way around
        - most features are accessed via context menus
    2. place your tests in a test case
        - their structure: test suite, test case, test step
        - other features work better when this structure is followed
    3. use meaningful names for test components
    4. use assertions in your tests
    5. learn how to transfer properties
        - specifically, something from a response into the next request
        - e.g., session id from login, needed in all subsequent requests
    6. read the responses
    7. read the log
    8. do a quick load test
    9. RTFM
    10. be active in the soapui community
