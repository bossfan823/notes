Projects
    o Client Onboarding Center (COC)
        + previously Paychex Account Migration Tool
            - how does this relate to PACO (Paychex Automated Client Onboarding)?
                . this seems like a term referring to the new system
                . actually, don't think so ... this appears to be for new clients,
                        new system is to "migrate" existing clients
                . or not ... "migrate" may mean convert from client's current source data to
                        form need to import to CA
        + OBC is a new 2018 tool designed to provide more automation and reliability when
                loading new clients
            - PACO is the proces for onboarding new clients
            - OBC integrate into PACO by taking inputs at an early stage in PACO, improving the content
                    of the data, then resubmitting the improved files back into the PACO pipeline
            - PACO ultimately submits its data to CA
            - OBC has a schema in the Local SQL Server database
            - some design pages show OBC submitting data directly to CA

    o JavaCPT

    o AMA (Automated Migration Application)
        + newer pages suggest its output bypasses PACO, goes directly to CA
        + i think this is a test database for clients to be migrated:
                jdbc:ucanaccess:////DEV-D-91Z9D/chud/PACOdb/PTF_be_dev.accdb
                jdbc driver here: http://ucanaccess.sourceforge.net/site.html
        + older process
            - use Configurator and PACO to gather client information
            - submitted to CA using App2App interface
        + new AMA process
            - does not "directly" use Configurator or PACO
            - accesses Configurator's MS Access database for MMS client info
            - generates XML passed to CA via App2App
            - PACO eliminated
            - monitors the same directories for files dropped for submission to CA
                . actually, may be a separate shared application, SubmitInfoPath
                
    o CA Comparator (Client Audit Tool)
        + validates effectiveness of a client import from MMS
            - by comparing client data as seen in MMS and post-import CA


Testing
    O ATM (Adaptive Test Management)
        - manages manual test cases
        - replaces HP's ALM tool
        - tests accessible here: https://issues.paychex.com/secure/Tests.jspa#/design?projectId=12808
    o TAF
        - selenium-based UI test framework
        - AutomationManager lets testers script the tests
        - AutomationCenter executes the tests
        

PROBLEM
    o could not run SQL Server Configuration Manager, or Services
        + failing due to something about a snap-in
        + mmc is used to manage snap-ins
        + could not run mmc
            - see https://becomethesolution.com/you-cannot-open-microsoft-management-console-in-author-mode-because-of-current-computer-policies
            - in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\MMC
                . set RestrictAuthorMode to 0 (this lets mmc run)
                . set RestrictToPermittedSnapins to 0 (lets mmc create missing snap-ins automatically)

Local SQL Server
    o let install in default C: directories (both)
    o Instance name/ID: SQLExpress/SQLEXPRESS
    o mixed mode authentication: sa/passwordPASSWORD1
    o add user: automigrate/password
        + owner of new database: FlexMigrationsToolDB
