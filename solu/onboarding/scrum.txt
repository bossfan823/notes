    o definition: A framework for productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value
    o lightweight, simple to understand
    o it's NOT a process
    o framework consists of:
        + scrum teams
        + associated roles
        + events
        + artifacts
        + rules
    o founded on empirical process control theory
        - knowledge comes from experience
        - decisions made based on what is known
    o so use iterative, incremental approach
        + optimized predictibility
        + controls risk
    o three pillars:
        + transparency
            - stakeholders must be able to track progress
            - requires common, standard way of communicating
            - clear definition of done is crucial
        + inspection
            - watching for undesirable variances
        + adaptation
            - make changes when deviation detected
    o events for inspection and adaptation
        + sprint planning
        + daily scrum
        + sprint review
        + sprint retrospective
    o scrum team
        + product owner
            - responsible for maximizing the value of the product
            - sole person responsible for managing backlog
            - may get assistance, but is accountable
            - only one person, cannot be overridden, with regard to
                . product backlog
                . direction of development team
        + development team
            - do the work of creating a releasable increment of the product
            - they own decisions of how to implement the backlog
            - cross-functional, to minimize outside dependencies
            - no titles, no sub-teams, no exceptions
            - entire team owns accountability for delivering the release
            - 3 to 9 members
        + scrum master
            - responsible for ensuring scrum is enacted
            - manages outside interactions with the team
            - helps product owner create effective backlog
            - facilitates scrum events
            - removes impediments for the team
    o events
        + the sprint
            - limited to one month at most
            - has a clear goal of a done, releasable increment of the product
            - disallows changes that jeopardize the goal
            - does not allow quality to be sacrificed
            - rarely canceled, but can be if goal no longer makes sense
        + spring planning
            - time-boxed, e.g., max 8 hours for a one month sprint (3-5%)
            - only development team can decide how many backlog items to accept
            - define the "sprint goal", why the increment is being created
        + daily scrum
            - time-boxed to around 15 minutes
            - excludes product owner
            - team members answer
                . what did i do yesterday
                . what will i do today
                . are there any impediments to achieving the spring goal
        + sprint review
            - time-box to 4 hours for a one month sprint
            - includes entire scrum team, plus stakeholders
            - product owner reviews done and not done items
            - development team
                . discusses what went well
                . problems encountered and how they were resolved
                . demos new functionality (what was "done")
                . product owner reviews state of the backlog
                . preparation for next sprint planning
        + sprint retrospective
            - after sprint review but before next sprint planning
            - time-box three hours for one month sprint (relative)
            - inspect sprint regarding people, relationships, process, tools
            - list what went well
            - list potential improvements and changes for next sprint to achieve them
                . consider ways definition of done can be enhanced to improve quality
        + artifacts
            - product backlog
                . development team owns estimates
                . total work remaining for goal(s) must be available
            - sprint backlog
                . may be added to or deleted from to achieve the sprint goal
                . solely owned by the development team (not product owner)
