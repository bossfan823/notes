Based on the "gang of four" book

General pattern theory
    o definition
        + each pattern describes a common recurring problem, and then describes the core
                of a solution to that problem
    o four elements of a pattern
        + name
        + problem
        + solution
        + consequences
    o benefits
        + better design
        + improves team communication
        
Case study
    o 3D modeler

Singleton
    o one object for the entire application
        + or manage a fixed-size pool of objects
    o implementation details
        + singleton class:
            - defines a private constructor
            - defines a static member for the single instance
            - defines a getInstance() that creates the instance first time, and returns it
    o can this support inheritance, a customized singleton with additional functionality?
        + system property naming the class that should be instantiated by getInstance()

Builder
    o problem is creating complex objects
